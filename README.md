# Phoenix Config

My config for [Phoenix](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix).

This is a fairly customized/modified version of [danshan/.phoenix.js](https://gist.github.com/danshan/a2039396cfa19ec2379a19feacf05dc0) with inspirations taken from [fabiospampinato/phoenix](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/phoenix).

## Install Prerequisites

Install Phoenix

```sh
brew install --cask phoenix
```

Allow Phoenix in your system preferences

<kbd>System Preferences</kbd> &raquo; <kbd>Security & Privacy</kbd> &raquo; <kbd>Accessibility</kbd>

### Install Karabiner

Download and install Karabiner-Elements:

[https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)

Install my Karabiner-Elements configuration:

[https://github.com/ezrafree/karabiner-config](https://github.com/ezrafree/karabiner-config)

## Install Instructions

> Note: Whenever Phoenix is running and doesn't find a config, it will create an empty config file at `~/.phoenix.js`. Make sure Phoenix is not running when you clone this repo down, and if you find your config isn't taking effect, check to see if you have an empty file at `~/.phoenix.js`. If you do, make sure Phoenix isn't running, delete the file, and run Phoenix again. This should allow it to pick up your config at at `~/.config/phoenix`.

Clone to your `~/.config/phoenix` directory

Over HTTPS:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ezrafree/phoenix-config ~/.config/phoenix
```

Or over SSH:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ezrafree/phoenix-config.git ~/.config/phoenix
```

Make a copy of the example config

```sh
cd ~/.config/phoenix/config && cp example.config.js config.js
```

Now you can make any changes to `config.js` to configure.

## Debugging

If you run into problems, or when developing new features, you can follow the logs with:

```sh
log stream --process Phoenix
```

When developing, to log objects use `JSON.stringify()` with `Phoenix.log()`

```js
Phoenix.log('foo: ' + JSON.stringify(foo))
```

## Development

For development purposes, you may optionally install the node modules to enable ESLint.
